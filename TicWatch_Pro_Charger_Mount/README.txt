# Summary

TickwatchPRO only
i designed this so i would stop losing the actual charger for my watch, (many many cables to sift nightly)
you simply snap the charge base into this mount. the included picture was an accidental nice fit, and actually clips nicely to my night stand. 
it is possible to easily take the mount out with little effort if needed. 
i did try to leave a little tolerance room for most printers. 
the portion at the top hole area was actually to tame the 3mm charger wire when used as a hanging mount. but by using a large binder clip, you can do what i did with it. 
all you have to do is take your watch, and set it above the chargermount and it will snap and hold the watch into its charging position. 
<b>EDIT: V2</b> more mounting holes, tigher grip, and T-bar at top with ziptie hole for using a large binder clip to mount it on a shelf (how i have been using it since the first night)
edit:labeling... there is no "k" in "TicWatch"
