# Summary

circuit playground mount for common sports camera setups. this is the mount part of an auto lighting system im working on. when the printerbed/CP moves, the lights come on... no movement, and it goes into a standby colour. hopefully i documented the code good enough for anyone to manipulate the it to their liking let me know if you would like me to explore changes, or if you made changes. 

the code for the Circuit Playground express is at 
https://github.com/Migamix/microcontroller/tree/master/CPX_motion_light
(dont forget to put the ino file in its own same named directory)

companion project is https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3040845

future versions will be added here since this is all for one type of mount for 1 type of device. if you like this, keep checking back. there will be better updates. i expect to be updating the code too, feel free to use it for other projects. 

v1 yes im aware it doesn't give much room from the CPX to the camera, use a right angle USB or mount upside down, it will still work.  v2 plans are to have the CP mounted on the side for full cable clearance, and still able to tie in to its pins for add on sensors or other devices. 

V2 & V2.3: shifted the CP to the side, and put a little flair on the mount, difference with each, the CP plate on v2 is very thin (~1mm) and needs care when removing from build deck, v2.3 has a 3mm mounting plate. hollowed out the back to save plastic, and so uclips can be mounted and run out of the back for future projects. 

(no file yet) update, i have found there is a space issue with a lack table enclosure and a bed riding camera. i will be making another version to add to this file.
