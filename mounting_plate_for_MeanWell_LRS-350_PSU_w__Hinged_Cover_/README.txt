# Summary

why i did this remix (only thing changed on original files is a notch, but im not the original source, so i will not claim it as such)
While recapping my Amiga1200 i foolishly let go of the strand of solder and would you guess, it bounced right into one of the slits of the the PSU i was using as a bench power supply (pulled from my PrusaMK3 since i already did a LRS-350 upgrade and had that spare PS.) so, why not get another LRS350-24 since i liked its features and fits my bench PS needs perfectly. 
I stumbled across this PS design with hinged cover from FastEddy516, with the fusion 360 files provided and went to work making a fresh mounting base and plate that could be removed or upgraded if needed. FE's original design used on this made it so much safer to be used without dropping tools or conductive things in my 120VAC terminals on my super cramped workbench (pictured above). i have several Drok Boost/Buck DC converters that give very stable adjustable multi output. 
Anyone looking for mods, changes, or info... contact me.
As the original makers of this project gave their source files, so shall i. (watch the history of this by 3 different people, its interesting.)
i already know ill make more changes, and will update them when made.
